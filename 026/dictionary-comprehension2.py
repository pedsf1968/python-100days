# You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called weather_f that takes each temperature in
# degrees Celsius and converts it into degrees Fahrenheit.
#
# To convert temp_c into temp_f use this formula:
# (temp_c * 9/5) + 32 = temp_f
# Celsius to Fahrenheit chart
# Use picture.png

# weather_c = eval(input())
weather_c = {"Monday": 12, "Tuesday": 14, "Wednesday": 15, "Thursday": 14, "Friday": 21, "Saturday": 22, "Sunday": 24}
# ğŸš¨ Don't change code above ğŸ‘†


# Write your code ğŸ‘‡ below:

def fahrenheit_to_celsius(temperature):
    return (temperature * 9/5) + 32


weather_f = {day: fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp) for day,temp in weather_c.items()}

print(weather_f)
