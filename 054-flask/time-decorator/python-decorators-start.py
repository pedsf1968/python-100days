# Objective
# Create your own decorator function to measure the amount of seconds that a function takes to execute.
#
# Expected Output
# 1695050908.1985211
# fast_function run speed: 0.33974480628967285s
# slow_function run speed: 2.9590742588043213s
# Calculating Time
# time.time() will return the current time in seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00. Try running the starting code
# to see the current time printed.
#
# If you run the code after a while, you'll see a new time printed. e.g. first run:
# 1598524371.736911
# second run:
# 1598524436.357875
#
# The time difference = second run - first run
# 64.62096405029297
# (approx 1 minute)
#
# Given the above information, complete the code exercise by printing out the time it takes to run the fast_function()
# vs the slow_function(). You will need to complete the speed_calc_decorator() function.
#
# Output example with time elapsed

import time
current_time = time.time()
print(current_time) # seconds since Jan 1st, 1970
