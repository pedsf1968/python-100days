# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
# "Your score is **z**."

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
all_names = (name1 + name2).lower()
score = 0
for t in "true":
   score+=all_names.count(t)*10

for l in "love":
    score+=all_names.count(l)

if score < 10 | score > 90:
    print(f"Your score is **{score}**, you go together like coke and mentos.")
elif score < 50 & score > 40:
    print(f"Your score is **{score}**, you are alright together.")
else:
    print(f"Your score is **{score}**.")
