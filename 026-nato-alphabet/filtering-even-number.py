# In this list comprehension exercise you will practice using list comprehension to filter out the even numbers from a
# series of numbers.
# First, use list comprehension to convert the list_of_strings to a list of integers.
#
# Then use list comprehension again to create a new list called result. This new list should only contain the even
# numbers from the list numbers.
#
# Again, try to use Python's List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
#
# Example Input
# 9, 0, 32, 8, 2, 8, 64, 29, 42, 99
# Example Output
# [0, 32, 8, 2, 8, 64, 42]
# Hint
# Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.
#
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

list_of_strings = input().split(',')

list_of_integer = [int(s) for s in list_of_strings]

# TODO: Use list comprehension to filter out the odd numbers

result = [number for number in list_of_integer if number % 2 == 0]

# Write your code ğŸ‘† above:
print(result)
