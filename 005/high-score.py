# You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.
# e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]
# Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e
# The highest score in the class is: x

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

highest_score = 0
#Write your code below this row 👇
for score in student_scores:
  if score > highest_score:
    highest_score = score

# More simple
highest_score = max(student_scores)

print(f"The highest score in the class is: {highest_score}")
