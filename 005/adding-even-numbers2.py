# You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:
# i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100
# Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.
# Hint
# There are quite a few ways of solving this problem, but you will need to use the range() function in any of the solutions.
target = int(input("Enter a number between 0 and 1000: "))

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
even_sum = 0
for number in range(2, target+1, 2):
    even_sum += number

print(even_sum)
