# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")

height_float = float(height)
weight_float = float(weight)
bmi = weight_float/height_float**2
# print(weight + " รท (" + height + " x " + height + ") = " + str(bmi))
print(str(int(bmi)))
