# You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.
# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.
# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:
# [['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]
# This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}" to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 square, each on a new line. 
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system. 
# The first digit in the input will specify the column (the position on the horizontal axis).
# The second digit in the input will specify the row number (the position on the vertical axis). 

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
row1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this row 👇
column = int(int(position)/10)
row = int(position) - 10*column
map[row-1][column-1] = "X"



#Write your code above this row 👆

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
